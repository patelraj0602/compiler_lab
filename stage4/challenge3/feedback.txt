Done => Add type checks for write(type has to int) and while(type has to bool) constructs in the Create Tree function
Done => data types include void,int,str,bool.
Done => Maintain an stack in codeGen for supporting break and continue.
Later_Stage => Refactor the code for declarations. Make an global table to store the data types.
    (Wherever there are two branchs always check for type compatibility before creating the tree.)
Done => Refer the data structures given in the documentation.

Will Consider based on later stages => Return an struct in codeGen that returns value and address and maybe register numbers of any particular variable.
