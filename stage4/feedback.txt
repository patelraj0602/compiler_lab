=> Refactor the code for declarations. Make an global table to store the data types.
=> Add type checks for write(type has to int) and while(type has to bool) constructs in the Create Tree function
    (Wherever there are two branchs always check for type compatibility before creating the tree.)
=> Refer the data structures given in the documentation.
=> Change that ternary tree structure which was introduced for if/else constructs.
=> Maintain an stack in codeGen for supporting break and continue.
=> Return an struct in codeGen that returns value and address and maybe register numbers of any particular variable.
=> data types include void,int,str,bool.
